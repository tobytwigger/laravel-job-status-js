## About

You can find the full repository at [https://github.com/tobytwigger/laravel-job-status](https://github.com/tobytwigger/laravel-job-status).

![example of job status in use](https://github.com/tobytwigger/laravel-job-status/blob/develop/docs/images/podcast.gif "Showing the user the status of their podcast being uploaded")

Laravel Job Status provides a simple way to track your jobs and show the progress to your users.

- Show your users the ongoing progress of your job without refreshing the page.
- Let users cancel running jobs
- Customisable Vue component for displaying your own jobs

## Docs

We've taken care over documenting everything you'll need to get started and use Laravel Job Status fully.

[Check out the docs](https://tobytwigger.github.io/laravel-job-status) on our documentation site.

[comment]: <> (To build them locally, you'll need to have ruby &#40;we'd recommend using rbenv&#41; and the gem bundler &#40;https://bundler.io/&#41; installed. Run `bundle install && bundle exec jekyll serve` in the docs folder.)

## Examples

### Show users the status of their jobs

The following is enough to show a user the status of the 'process podcast' job for the podcast with the ID `podcastId`.

```vue
<job-status job="process-podcast" :tags="{podcast: podcastId}">
<template v-slot:default="{status, lastMessage, complete, cancel, signal}">

    <spinner v-if="complete === false"></spinner>
    <p>The status of the job is {{status}}</p>
    <p>{{lastMessage}}</p>
    <v-button @click="cancel" type="danger">Cancel</v-button>
</template>
<template v-slot:empty>
    Upload a podcast to get started
</template>
</job-status>
```

### Track a job

Tracking is simple to enable on any job.

```php
class ProcessPodcast
{
    use Trackable;

    protected Podcast $podcast;

    public function handle()
    {
        // Upload and process the podcast
    }

    public function tags(): array
    {
        return [
            'podcast' => $this->podcast->id,
            'user' => $this->user->id
        ];
    }

    public function alias(): string
    {
        return 'process-podcast';
    }

}
```
